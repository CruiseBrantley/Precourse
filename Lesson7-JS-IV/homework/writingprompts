Writing Prompts

Objects: Objects are structures of other data combined under one name.
Properties: Properties are the names of the data that form structures.
Methods: Methods are like Functions, except they exist within objects.
For in loop: A special loop that was created to give you the contents of an object.
Dot notation is the normal way to interact with an object's data,
     bracket notation is mostly useful when you don't know what the properties are called or need them in a variable.
